proxy(server side rendering):-we are building node js server that act as a fake server
the browser will not call the api directly
our server will call the api convert data into html and then send the html to the browser
browser->server->api->data->server->html->browser
fetch happens int he server not on the browser
If you cant see the api call in the browser then fetch is happening in the server
API need JSON browser need html and server does the conversion
hydrate template + data->final html
if api is not visible inside network tag then it is protected
frontend fetch depends on api speed proxy hides api and gives control
