HTTP(hyper text transfer protocol) it is an communication protocol used to transfer data between client(browser) and server to talk
HTTP stateless-> it means server does not remember any previous request from the client
HTTP stateful-> it means server remembers the previous request from the client
previous request
user data
login state
bcz of this we use cookies ,sessions and jwt tokens
HTTP request structure-> Every request has 4 main parts
1. URL
2. HTTP Method
3. Headers
4. Body(optional)
HTTP methods-> 
1. GET-> to fetch data from server
2. POST-> to send data to server
3. PUT-> to update data in server
4. DELETE-> to delete data from server
5. PATCH-> to partially update data in server
6. HEAD-> to get headers from server
7. OPTIONS-> to get options from server
8. TRACE-> to get trace from server
9. CONNECT-> to get connect from server
Headers->Extra information about the request 
exmaple:- content-type,application/json,semicolon,authorization data format and caching
Body->it contains actual data sent to the server only in post,put,patch methods
server response structure-> Every response has 4 main parts
1. Status Code
2. Headers
3. Body(optional)
Node js follows an event listener type architecture
1. Event loop
2. Event emitter
3. Event handler
HTTP module is a built in module in node js and we use it to create a server
Create server-> it register a server and this callback runs every time a request is made.
Except Callback
callback runs on every request
listen-> it starts the server and listen for incoming requests
req-> request object
res-> response object
backend never sends data as json
JSON-> javascript object notation
reason behind using json->bcz frontend understand json easily
setting response header->res.wrightHead()
set status code->res.statusCode
set response header->res.setHeader()
example:-200->Success
404->Not Found
500->Internal Server Error
600->Custom Error
Sending the response body->res.write()
ending the response->res.end() it ends the response
sends data to client
JSON.stringify()-> it converts json to string
start listening of the port->server.listen()
start server 
port=communication end point
Routing-> it is a process of matching the url with the request(url based request handling)
diff url->diff response
implement using req.url
